# straightjacket
git repo for the straightjacket compiler

This is the 2017 rewrite of the straightjacket compiler.  I wrote it in Ruby, and it output c code rather than creating executables.  In this version, I got as far as implementing these features:

- literate programming
- modules
- booleans
- trees
- abort statements
- procedures
- functions
