# straightjacket
git repo for the straightjacket compiler

This is the 2012 version of the straightjacket compiler.  I wrote it in Pascal, and it output LLVM code rather than creating executables.  In this version, I got as far as implementing these features:

- literate programming
- modules
- functions
- procedures
- halt statements
- chars
