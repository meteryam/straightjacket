# variableDeclarationOutput = sjList.list(variableSnippet)

# lists are non-null by default, and if-then statements must explicitly check for nulls
# constants cannot be null

# standard list operators:  

	# first:  {0}
	
	# last:  {-1}
	
	# append:  &
	
	# make a list:  if variables are used as arguments, they are passed by value.  if constants are used as arguments, they are passed by reference.
	
	# library ideas:  reverse, rest, member
	
# special value:  TOP

	# allows lists to become rings
